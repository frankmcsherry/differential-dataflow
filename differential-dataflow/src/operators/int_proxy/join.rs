//! The proxy join framework.
//!
//! A conventional differential join against ordered, copyable proxies.
//! The backend interprets proxies and is relieved of lattice-time reasoning.
//!
//! The backend asks for that relief a key at a time.
//! It may *complete* a key itself, producing the key's whole output, or *present* the key for the tactic to match.
//! A join has no schedule to get wrong: a key's output is every pair of its updates, at the join of their times, with the product of their diffs.
//! A backend that can state that for a key, because the key's updates are few or share one time, need not present it.
//! What the tactic offers is the replay that bounds the work on a key with a long history on both sides.
